Mazes - a puzzle game, where you enter a maze-like level, with the aim of collecting multiple gems and then be able to return where you started from.

Controls:
WASD and Arrows to move your character
R to reset your current level and Z to undo your previous move
Esc to leave the level you are in

Mechanics:
Empty block - Pretty selfexplanatory, the type of blocks you are able to step on
Wall - The one block that you can't step on
The exit block - The one block that looks like a door. If you haven't collected all gems on the level you might as well consider it for an empty block
Moving blocks - The brown blocks that look like cartons have the ability to be pushed around (and you can push multiple at once if they are in a row). Also, you can push them only if on the end there is empty space, otherwise you'll do nothing (The exit block is not considered an empty space)
Gems - The red diamond like blocks you are trying to collect. Similar to the exit block, you cannot overlap them with a moving block
Tunnels - A more seldom used mechanic, it is basically what it sounds like - a two-way tunnel that transports you from one end to another if there is free space. Also you will some tunnels with arrows around them. Upon doing any kind of move, these tunnels will change their directions

The main menu:
The main menu is designed to look like just like a level, however instead of collecting gems, you are selecting a level, by staying on one of those "exit blocks" and hitting Enter. Also in the down-right edge you will notice a different door. This is supposed to be a level editor that would help me test new levels. It is not fully done and it may have some bugs.
